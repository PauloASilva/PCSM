Proactive Citizens Symptoms Monitoring
======================================

This is a functional prototype (a weekend project) developed during the COVID-19
pandemic in Portugal.

Taking advantage of open source and free technologies and available programmable
voice and email delivering services, this system can potentially monitor every
citizen for symptoms on a regular basis.

You can [see it in action on Youtube][1].
The system provides three interaction interfaces:

* A website for user signup and filling out a questionnaire regarding
  symptomatology. Users can also invite other people like family or someone else
  they were in touch with (we're talking about a pandemic scenario);
* An automatic phone call to answer the same questionnaire available on the
  website. The phone call only happens when the email address was not provided
  or the user didn't re-evaluate its health condition in the past 24 hours;
* A dashboard for aggregated live data analysis by the national health
  organization.

I strongly believe that the capability and real-time data this system can
provide, national health organizations would be able to take early measures to
contain infection propagation.
